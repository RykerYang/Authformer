## Database Introduction

### LUTBIO Database

The LUTBIO database is a self-constructed multimodal biometric database focusing on the elderly population. It encompasses nine types of biometric data: voice, face, fingerprint, contact-based palmprint, electrocardiogram (ECG), opisthenar, ear, contactless palmprint, and periocular. The database contains biometric data for 306 subjects. It is one of the most comprehensive multimodal biometric databases currently available, providing diverse biometric modalities suitable for evaluating the performance of biometric systems.

### XJTU Database

The XJTU database includes 102 volunteers and focuses on four biometric modalities: face, voice, contact-based palmprint, and fingerprint. It is another valuable database for researchers to conduct experiments in the multimodal biometric field.

## Reason for Using These Databases

Currently, the availability of large-scale multimodal biometric databases is limited. To address this limitation, we conducted a review of the existing databases.

### Overview of Existing Multimodal Biometric Databases

A multimodal biometric database refers to a database that contains at least two types of biometric modality data for the same individual. Most multimodal biometric databases available for researchers include more than two biometric modalities, such as voice and face. For example:

- FVT Database: Provides biometric modality data including face, voice, and dental information for 50 individuals.

- Mobits Database: Offers signature, voice, face, iris, and hand geometry biometric modality data for 53 volunteers.

- UMDAA Database: Contains face and behavioral data for 48 volunteers.

- CSIP Database: Comprises data from 50 subjects and captures iris and peri-ocular biometric characteristics. Unlike other databases, this database uses four different smartphone devices for data collection.

Most multimodal biometric databases are limited in the number of subjects and types of biometric modalities, typically not exceeding 155 people and 4 biometric modalities. Additionally, the subjects are mainly from universities and research institutions, lacking the variability present in real environments.

### Summary and Comparison of Databases

This paper summarizes and compares multimodal biometric databases with more than 106 volunteers based on six key indicators:

- Number of multimodal biometric characteristics.

- Publication year.

- Number of subjects.

- Availability.

- Type of biometric characteristics (physiological/behavioral).

- Total number of biometric characteristics.
